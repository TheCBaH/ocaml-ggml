## Current Focus

*   Finalized plan for OCaml ctypes binding generation. Verification step confirmed as `make`. [2025-04-17 04:57:07]

## Recent Changes

*   Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
*   Created `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
*   Created `memory-bank/progress.md`.
*   Created `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`.
*   Created `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
*   Analyzed C header (`src/gpt-2-lib.h`), lib conventions (`lib/*`), and build setup (`src/dune`). [2025-04-17 04:56:32]

## Open Questions/Issues

*   ~~Need to confirm the specific conventions used in `lib/ggml` for ctypes bindings.~~ (Resolved by analysis)
*   ~~Need to determine the best location for the new binding files (e.g., `src/` or `lib/`).~~ (Resolved: Use existing `src/` structure)
*   ~~Clarification needed: Use 'make' or 'dune build' for final verification?~~ (Resolved: Use `make`) [2025-04-17 04:57:07]
